This program allows you to label millions of images with the assistance of a CNN.
You manually will label a subset of the unlabeled images, then train the CNN and let it
have a go at labeleing.  After, you grade its top best, worst, and uncertain guesses
to add more manually added labels.   Then you repeat until its scoring in the percentile
you deisre.
